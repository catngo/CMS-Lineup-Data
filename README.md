# Lineup Data for CMS Men's Basketball

From play by play logs on CMS website, I scraped the lineup data and wrote a script to read the logs that keep track of conventional statisitics and plus/minus for each distinct lineup.

From there, I extract lineup data of individual player, combination of two and three players.

In 2016-2017 folder, it has the data for 2016-2017 season in separate Home and Away games.

In 2017-2018, it contains the data of the current season and current analysis I do for the team.

In Script, it contains the code I use to scrape logs, generate lineup data and write it out to csv files.

In Analyze, it is the current analysis of last season data set.

Go Stags!
